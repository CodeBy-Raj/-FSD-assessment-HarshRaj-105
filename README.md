# Bulb Toggle Web App

A simple interactive web application where users can dynamically generate and toggle bulbs on and off based on their input. This project is perfect for beginners to learn DOM manipulation, dynamic element creation, and event handling in JavaScript.

## Features

- **Dynamic Bulb Generation**: Enter the desired number of bulbs to display on the screen.
- **Toggle Bulbs**: Each bulb comes with a toggle button to switch between "on" and "off" states.
- **Responsive Design**: The application adjusts well to different screen sizes.

## How It Works

1. **Start**:
   - Click the **"Start"** button to display an input dialog.
2. **Enter Input**:
   - Enter the number of bulbs you want to generate and click **"DONE"**.
3. **Toggle Bulbs**:
   - Use the **"Toggle"** button below each bulb to switch it between "on" and "off" states.
4. **Reset**:
   - Click the **"Start"** button (now acting as **"Reset"**) to clear the setup and restart.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the application.
- **CSS**: For styling the interface.
- **JavaScript**: For DOM manipulation and interactivity.
